Here is the timeline for progress into this project. The aim is to reach a production-ready consumer version that can be adopted in the first place by the medical staff being in the front line of the COVID-19 combat. Later versions are also expected to target a wider user population. 

## Most recent update

## Older iterations
`May 5th`: Having collected the comments received from the V0_2_0, a new improved V0_3_0 version is presented here.  It is aimed at weight reduction and an optimization for the 3D printing process. This model adds support extra Ribs, so that the over-hang planes could be handled without extra support prints or inside fills. 
The following video gives an idea about the new V03 decomposition aiming for an easier 3D printing experience.
