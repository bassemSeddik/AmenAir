### Welcome to the AmenAir project description

Here is the timeline for progress into this project. The aim is to reach a production-ready consumer version that can be adopted in the first place by the medical staff being in the front line of the COVID-19 combat. Later versions are also expected to target a wider user population. 

## Most recent update
`February 1st - up to now`: After a full-teaching first semester, this second semester of 2021 marks the retake for the project with two teams : (1) in the ISET of Sousse and (2) in the ENISo Enginering School of Sousse. The aim for now is to launch a startup that capable of selling the aimed product. 
- Team 1: Three end of studies projects have been lauched in  electronics, informatics and mechanics. They aim at the creation of Arduino-based cicuit board, the Android related App and the new 3D design(s) for the impoved version of AmenAir PAPR.
- Team 2: Two Engineers have joined the team on two more advanced tasks: The circuit integrated board conception under the Altium electronics software, and, The implementation of the SaaS logic for the IoT connected Cloud/multiplaform dedicated solution. 
- Myself beeing a working member of the projet, I just got the SolidWorks surfacing certification, some extra electonics training, and I am ready for the journey. Also, I am interested in joining efforts with skilled members willing the take part of the efforts on a win-win basis. 

`May 29th`: We started checking the electronic circuits that could be implemented within the AmenAir Helmet. Thanks, are addressed to Mr. Ahmed Anis who passed a whole day testing different implementations on both the Arduino-UNO and the NANO ones. Additional possible implementations might also call to an independent microcontroller, or even relying on the basic electronic component to create a power divider circuit (among other ideas). For now, the mains functionalities we are thinking about include:
- Different levels of fan speed according to a switch handled by the user (the helmet porter)
- A set of LEDs to display the battery status in front of the user
- An automatic speed change for the fan according to the obstruction conditions. for that, it would be preferable to find a way to measure the amount of air delivered by the fan per minute, etc.

## Older iterations
`May 19th`: This video presentation (in Arabic) makes a test use-case of the AmenAir V0_1_10 prototype. It also gives the realization steps and the next coming improvement steps :

`May 5th`: Having collected the comments received from the V0_2_0, a new improved V0_3_0 version is presented here.  It is aimed at weight reduction and an optimization for the 3D printing process. This model adds support extra Ribs, so that the over-hang planes could be handled without extra support prints or inside fills. 
The following video gives an idea about the new V03 decomposition aiming for an easier 3D printing experience.

`April 28th`: Based on initial models proposed by the team member, an improved v0_2_0 iteration has been proposed. You can find the description PFD document here-after with additional image captures :
